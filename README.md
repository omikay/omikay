### Hello, World!
Omid here.

I'm a tech/finance/music/... enthusiast working as a product marketing manager at [Nito Labs](https://nitolabs.com). I'm contributing to realizing the company's vision of promoting utility, inclusion, and ownership for humans through blockchain. I'm also working as the product manager at [Fluxity](https://fluxity.finance), a token streaming solution on Stellar. I also contribute to the backend of Fluxity.

‚è≥ I transitioned from mechanical engineering to ML and data analytics before focusing on product management and marketing. It was hard and bumpy, but I stayed positive and loved every bit of it.

üî≠ Besides my job, I‚Äôm currently working on a management platform for finding and organizing non-profit events called [Impakt](https://github.com/omikay/rcdd-capstone-impakt), which started out as the capstone project for [Re:Coded](https://www.re-coded.com/)'s backend development bootcamp.

üå± I‚Äôm expanding my experience and knowledge about product management, business intelligence, and web development.
