### Hello, World!
Omid here.

I'm a product person striving to make life easier and more pleasant for people by understanding their pain points and building user-centric solutions. 

In my latest role as a **Product Manager** at **[Nito Labs](https://nitolabs.com)**, I managed a cross-functional team of product designers and developers to build a mobile-first, multifunctional, self-custodial digital wallet, **[Pino](https://pino.xyz/)**, enabling interaction with top decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols with maximum accessibility and efficiency. 

I've also managed the development and contributed to the backend of **[Fluxity](https://fluxity.finance)**, a token streaming solution on Stellar, enhancing payment flexibility in a way that incentivizes consistent quality work by providers and promotes demand and loyalty by consumers.

‚è≥ Product management was something I've had my eyes on since transitioning from mechanical engineering to ML and data analytics. It was hard and bumpy, but I loved every bit of it.

üå± I'm always expanding my experience and knowledge about product, business, and development to better understand what and how to build and better work with those I build with.
